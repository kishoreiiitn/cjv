# [0.7.0](https://github.com/kishoreiiitn/flowjv/compare/v0.5.3...v0.7.0) (2021-02-10)


### Bug Fixes

* refpath types. Move to yarn workspace. ([ecb804c](https://github.com/kishoreiiitn/flowjv/commit/ecb804c50c7fc5351ce2404bc1c93745bf619bb5))


### Features

* add ability to nest if blocks. Complete changeover to the internal logic ([aa532b8](https://github.com/kishoreiiitn/flowjv/commit/aa532b852cefd993d439f9ffe8af5c5043c3d877))
* change complete architecture of flowjv ([52092a5](https://github.com/kishoreiiitn/flowjv/commit/52092a56fed60ce65f96eb96a3b4208beee7d9ed))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* FlowJV is complete rewritten. The underlying principles remain same, but the schema
is significantly modified. Now FlowJV has better types support, seamless nested conditional blocks,
automatically infer data dependencies from JSON expression. Now flowjv-react-custom package uses
material ui and not custom css as was the case before.
